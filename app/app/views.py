# FLAW: Injection
# ---------------
# Slightly contrived example. The notes a user creates are processed
# through an insecure formatter which is meant to create proper links
# out of sequences that look like urls, see above at _text_urlize_insecure.
# In order to properly show these as links, they are also marked as safe,
# falsely so because they're still vulnerable to injection. In reality, there's
# number of problems that might be possible to work out using proper
# Django functions here, but it's for illustrating what certainly not to
# do.
#
# In contrast, the proper version simply uses the "urlize" filter
# directly in the html rather than even doing anything here. This avoids (at least some of)
# the problems of the more naive approach. It must be noted that I'm not
# entirely sure about the security efficacy of the urlize filter either:
# It is said that "[i]f urlize is applied to text that already contains HTML markup,
# or to email addresses that contain single quotes ('), things wonâ€™t work as expected.
# Apply this filter only to plain text."
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/templates/builtins/#urlize
# However, it is unclear what the actual problem here is: the quoted
# text is simply a "Note" block, rather than a "Warning", for example,
# and looking at the source code, proper escaping seems to be performed
# and the resulting text appears to be set as safe (like the mark_safe above,
# apart from the fact that the above most decidedly is not safe).
# It may be that using urlize on non-"plain text" simply gives slightly
# odd results, which certainly is the case, like in the case of an email
# having a single quote being cut off. Some testing on my part has also not uncovered
# any (security) problems with the urlize.

# resource in the browser. See `get_kwargs` in both versions for
